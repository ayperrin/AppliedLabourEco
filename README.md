This repository contains the R and python codes run on the CASD environment in Hugo Lamothe and Aymeric Perrin's project for the Applied Labour Economics course (2nd semester, 3rd year, ENSAE) taught by Roland Rathelot.

It requires acces to EEC database along with accounting data from DGFiP (https://data.economie.gouv.fr/explore/dataset/balances-comptables-des-regions-/information/) to run.
